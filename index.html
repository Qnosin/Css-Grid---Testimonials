                        things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. the agile team project, in particular was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                        next level in a way that no tutorail could ever have. in fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development exeperience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                        multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
